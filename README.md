# Python-Physics
A python script that does high school level AP physics problems. If you plan on using this for cheating, don't. I created this only to help learn the language and not as a way to get out of homework.

It currently doesn't work because I didn't do a very good job of version control, and messed up my only save when trying to add in calculation for friction.
