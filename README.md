# Python-Physics
A python script that does high school level AP physics problems. Currently only 2D projectile motion, but friction and attwood machine calculations are on the way.
If you plan on using this for cheating, don't. I created this only to help learn the language and not as a way to get out of homework or cheat on tests.
